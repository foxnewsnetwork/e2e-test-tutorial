# Introduction

## About this Tutorial
This is the beginning of the end-to-end spec testing tutorial, going through this tutorial should be the first steps in helping not only write step-by-step spec tests, but also get you started into the world of javascript programming.

The structure of this tutorial is unabashedly stolen from [LearnYouSomeErlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/introduction), which is in turn inspired by [LearnYouSomeHaskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction). If you're truly aspiring to joy the autistic ranks of a software developer, sooner or later, you probably should go through those other tutorials. But for now, let's start with spec testing with javascript.

## What are Spec Tests?

Spec tests, also called Acceptance tests in Ember land, is a type of software test that treats the entirety of an application as a black box, we make assertions directly on the visual appearance of the app, and we drive the app by simulating user interactions. The advantage of these tests is that they directly and actually test your app exactly as your end users will eventually see it.

In many ways, if the world of software bug hunting is a disease, then unit tests are what the developers use in the development of curative drugs, while end-to-end spec tests are the doctors who give you your daily dose of health.
